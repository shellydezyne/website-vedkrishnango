Meta tags have to be placed in the so called HEAD part of the website. For example, we want to sell wooden garden furniture on our website. We start very simple by adding a title, keywords and a description. Take a look at the example below. We use colored letters in this example so it makes reading HTML easier. The colors have no effect or influence on the results in a search engine.

Step 1 Adjust the title in the source

The first phrase you will see and will click on in the search engines is the title. Make sure your title is effective and attractive. 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<html>
 <head>
  <title>All our wooden furniture is water proof.</title>
 </head>

<body>

  This is a test text

</body>
</html>
Step 2 Adding keywords - keyword meta tag example

Add maximal 20 keywords and seperate them from each other by a comma en a space.
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<html>
 <head>
  <title>All our wooden furniture is water proof.</title>
  <meta name="keywords" content="wood, furniture, garden, garden-table, etc.">

 </head>

<body>

  This is a test text

</body>
</html>
 
Step 3 Adding a relevant description - meta description tag
 

The description are the phrases that will appear under every title in Google, Yahoo, Bing and other search engines.  The search engines show the description you add to your meta tags so it's important to make a relevant description for every single page on your website.

 
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<html>
 <head>
  <title>All our wooden furniture is water proof.</title>
  <meta name="keywords" content="wood, furniture, garden, garden-table, etc.">
  <meta name="description" content="Official dealer of wooden garden furniture.">

 </head>

<body>

  This is a test text

</body>
</html>
 
Step 4 Provide relevant information

Without a doubt a good website has to provide good information. If writing relevant text is not your thing, you should hire a writer to help you make your text relevant and easy to read.
<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN">
<html>
 <head>
  <title>All our wooden furniture is water proof.</title>
  <meta name="keywords" content="wood, furniture, garden, garden-table, etc">
  <meta name="description" content="Official dealer of wooden garden furniture.">

 </head>

<body>

Think like a customer
 

This is just an example, very simple, so it's quite clear what the meaning is. Making correct meta tags is an accurate job!

Don't use words like computers, travel, books, gifts, consultancy in your text. The number of hits is enormous, for some more than 10.000. Give extra information and the change your site will be found is increasing.
